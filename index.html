Other options can lead to bone deterioration, and may interfere with eating, smiling, speaking and other activities of everyday life.</li><li><em><strong>Built to last.</strong></em> Dental implants are a long-term solution. Traditional, tooth-supported dental bridges only last five to seven years, and with proper care often more than 10 years, but at some point they may need to be replaced. While dental implants may need periodic adjustments, they can last a lifetime when properly placed and cared for over time.</li><li><em><strong>Enjoy life without worrying about your teeth! </strong></em>No need to stay home or feel uncomfortable in public, embarrassed because your smile looks different, or worrying that missing teeth will limit your ability to join in the fun or that removable dentures or tooth-supported replacement teeth will loosen or fall out when you talk, eat or laugh. Teeth restored with dental implants are teeth that let you, not your teeth, lead your life.</li><li><strong>Retain your natural face shape, and smile. </strong>A face without teeth can sag and appear sunken and sad. Dental implants allow you to maintain the natural shape of your face and smile.</li><li><em><strong>Protect healthy bone.</strong></em>Leaving empty spaces in your mouth after losing one or more teeth can lead to additional health issues, such as the loss and deterioration of some of your jawbone. When it is not being used to support a natural tooth, the jawbone deteriorates, losing its strength and firmness. Dental implants are the only dental restoration option that preserves and stimulates natural bone, actually helping to stimulate bone growth and prevent bone loss.</li><li><em><strong>Keep your teeth in your mouth – not in a cup. </strong></em>Dental implants allow you to keep your teeth where they belong – in your mouth. And no more worrying that your dentures might slip or fall out. Brush, floss and care for teeth that have been replaced using dental implants exactly the way you would natural teeth – in your mouth.</li><li><em><strong>Speak easy. </strong></em>Adjusting to removable dentures can mean struggling to pronounce everyday words. Not so with dental implants, which function like natural teeth.</li><li><em><strong>Eat your favorite foods!</strong></em><strong></strong>Taste and enjoy the foods you love without hesitation. You can bite naturally, eat virtually anything you want and, unlike removable dentures that can feel uncomfortable, you can experience the full taste of the food you eat with dental implants, too.</li><li><em><strong>Look Mum, no cavities!</strong></em>Cavities can’t occur in an implant-restored crown, or replacement tooth; however, you will need to visit your dentist as scheduled and clean and care for it and your gums and mouth every day, the same as you would if it were a natural tooth.</li><li><em><strong>Keep teeth in place – silently.</strong></em>Dentures may slip when you eat, talk, smile, laugh, kiss, yawn or cough, so that you have to “reposition” them back into place in the mouth. Dental implants are fixed in place and fuse naturally with your jawbone, meaning your replacement teeth won’t move, click or shift.</li><li><em><strong>Protect your healthy teeth.</strong></em> Placing a tooth-supported bridge requires grinding away the teeth on one or both sides of the missing tooth or teeth – thereby damaging healthy teeth to restore those that are missing. The modified healthy teeth are attached to, and support, the bridge. Dental implants go in the jawbone, in the spot where your missing tooth root was, without impacting healthy teeth. They also help prevent healthy, adjacent teeth from shifting as they would if an empty space were left for an extended period of time.</li><li><em><strong>More predictable than other repair and restoration methods.</strong></em> Dental implant treatment has a track record of reliable, long-term successful outcomes and is often considered 'more predictable' than other treatments to repair or replace missing teeth, including bridgework, removable appliances and retreatment of failing root canal (endodontic) therapy.</li></ul></div></div></div></section><section

</picture><h1>Cosmetic Dentist Bristol</h1><p>Cosmetic dentistry in Bristol includes any techniques that restore or improve the appearance of your teeth.</p><p>You will meet the dentist carrying out your procedure to discuss your care. It may differ from what is described here, as it will be designed to meet your individual needs.</p><p><strong>Teeth whitening</strong></p><p>Whitening can be used to make your teeth look whiter. There are a number of different bleaching methods available to lighten the shade of your teeth. Some you can buy and use at home; others you will need to have done by your dentist.<br> Your dentist
    will discuss your options with you and advise you which treatment is the most suitable.</p><p><strong>Whitening toothpastes</strong></p><p>Some whitening toothpastes gently polish your teeth and can help to remove surface stains. However, these don't change the natural shade of your teeth. Experts are currently looking into how well these toothpastes work.</p><p><strong>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits</strong></p><p>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits are sold in most pharmacies throughout the UK. They usually contain rubber mouth trays (moulds that are approximately the same shape as your teeth) and tubes of bleaching gel. The bleaching ingredient is usually hydrogen
    peroxide or carbamide peroxide. The kits will only contain a weak bleaching agent, so may not be very effective.<br> Always speak to your dentist before using an over-the-counter teeth whitening kit.</p><p><strong>Professional teeth whitening</strong></p><p>You may be able to whiten your teeth at home. If this treatment is suitable for you, your dentist will give you a specially made mouth tray and some whitening gel. Usually, you can wear the mouth tray for around eight hours each day, over a period of
    about two weeks. However, this will vary from person to person and may differ from what is described here, so make sure you follow your dentists advice.</p><p>You can also have your teeth whitened at your dental practice, where your treatment will be supervised by your dentist. Power bleaching is one type of treatment that can help to make your teeth whiter. Firstly, your dentist will place a rubber seal around
    your teeth to protect your gums. Then he or she will put the bleaching gel onto your teeth and use a bright light to speed up the whitening process. This treatment usually takes one or two hours.<br> Possible side-effects of bleaching include tooth
    sensitivity and gum irritation. The long-term effects of using these techniques aren't known. These bleaching techniques can keep your teeth whitened for up to three years, although this will be different for everyone. Speak to your dentist to get
    an idea of how long the effects will last.</p><p><strong>Straightening teeth</strong></p><p>Orthodontic treatment is used to straighten or move your teeth to improve their appearance or function. Straight teeth are easier to clean and less vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease.<br> Orthodontic treatment usually involves wearing a brace on
    your teeth. This puts gentle pressure on your teeth to move them into the right place. You will usually need to wear a brace for between six months and two years. During this time, your orthodontist will monitor your teeth closely and make adjustments
    to the brace.</p><p>Orthodontic treatment is usually carried out during childhood, but adults can have it as well.<br> There are several different types of brace. Some can be removed whereas others are fixed in place.</p><p><strong>Removable braces</strong></p><p>You can take removable braces out of your mouth at any time. They are made of plastic and usually have wires and springs to move specific teeth. Removable braces are commonly used to move your upper teeth. You will need to take your brace out to clean
    it, but otherwise you should wear it at all other times, including during mealtimes.</p><p><strong>Tooth restoration</strong></p><p>Many cosmetic dental treatments can be used to repair your teeth. Your dentist will be able to advise you which treatments are most suitable.</p><p><strong>Fillings</strong></p><p>Fillings are used to fill holes (cavities) that have formed in your teeth, usually as a result of decay.</p><p>There are two types of fillings – amalgam (silver) and composite (tooth-coloured).<br> Before your filling is fitted, your dentist will remove the decayed parts of your tooth and clean the cavity.</p><p>Amalgam fillings are made of a combination of metals including silver, tin, copper and mercury. Amalgam is extremely hard-wearing and can last for 15 to 20 years. Composite fillings can be used instead of amalgam as a natural-looking alternative. They
    are often used in teeth that show when you smile or talk. However, they don't tend to last as long as amalgam fillings. Your dentist will be able to advise you on which type of filling is best for you.</p><p><strong>Crowns</strong></p><p>If your tooth has been broken or weakened by a lot of decay or a large filling, your dentist may recommend fitting a crown. A crown is shaped like a natural tooth. It’s fitted over the top of your damaged tooth to disguise it. Crowns can be made of porcelain,
    gold or a combination of metal covered with tooth-coloured porcelain.<br> You will usually need to have at least two appointments to have a crown fitted. At the first, your dentist will prepare your tooth and place a temporary crown over your tooth.
    Then at the second appointment, your dentist will remove the temporary crown and fit the permanent one.</p><p><strong>Veneers</strong></p><p>If one of your front teeth is chipped or discoloured, a thin layer (veneer), can be made to fit over it. These are usually made of porcelain. Sometimes, if you have a small gap between your teeth, or if they are slightly crooked, veneers can be fitted
    to help them appear straighter.<br> You will usually need at least two visits to the dentist. At the first, your dentist will take a mould of your tooth, which is then used to make the veneer. He or she will also remove a small amount of the top layer
    of your tooth (enamel). On the second visit, your dentist will fix the veneer onto your tooth.<br> Veneers can last for several years, but they can be damaged just like normal teeth because of an accident, break or chip.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="168"><!-- react-empty: 169 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-b9807f58-dad4-4136-953a-d0d582dd3a66" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="170"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="171"><picture>

best thing to healthy, natural teeth. </strong></em>Strong and stable, a dental implant restores a lost tooth so that it looks, feels, fits and functions like a natural tooth. Other options can lead to bone deterioration, and may interfere with eating, smiling, speaking and other activities of everyday life.</li><li><em><strong>Built to last.</strong></em> Dental implants are a long-term solution. Traditional, tooth-supported dental bridges only last five to seven years, and with proper care often more than 10 years, but at some point they may need to be replaced. While dental implants may need periodic adjustments, they can last a lifetime when properly placed and cared for over time.</li><li><em><strong>Enjoy life without worrying about your teeth! </strong></em>No need to stay home or feel uncomfortable in public, embarrassed because your smile looks different, or worrying that missing teeth will limit your ability to join in the fun or that removable dentures or tooth-supported replacement teeth will loosen or fall out when you talk, eat or laugh. Teeth restored with dental implants are teeth that let you, not your teeth, lead your life.</li><li><strong>Retain your natural face shape, and smile. </strong>A face without teeth can sag and appear sunken and sad. Dental implants allow you to maintain the natural shape of your face and smile.</li><li><em><strong>Protect healthy bone.</strong></em>Leaving empty spaces in your mouth after losing one or more teeth can lead to additional health issues, such as the loss and deterioration of some of your jawbone. When it is not being used to support a natural tooth, the jawbone deteriorates, losing its strength and firmness. Dental implants are the only dental restoration option that preserves and stimulates natural bone, actually helping to stimulate bone growth and prevent bone loss.</li><li><em><strong>Keep your teeth in your mouth – not in a cup. </strong></em>Dental implants allow you to keep your teeth where they belong – in your mouth. And no more worrying that your dentures might slip or fall out. Brush, floss and care for teeth that have been replaced using dental implants exactly the way you would natural teeth – in your mouth.</li><li><em><strong>Speak easy. </strong></em>Adjusting to removable dentures can mean struggling to pronounce everyday words. Not so with dental implants, which function like natural teeth.</li><li><em><strong>Eat your favorite foods!</strong></em><strong></strong>Taste and enjoy the foods you love without hesitation. You can bite naturally, eat virtually anything you want and, unlike removable dentures that can feel uncomfortable, you can experience the full taste of the food you eat with dental implants, too.</li><li><em><strong>Look Mum, no cavities!</strong></em>Cavities can’t occur in an implant-restored crown, or replacement tooth; however, you will need to visit your dentist as scheduled and clean and care for it and your gums and mouth every day, the same as you would if it were a natural tooth.</li><li><em><strong>Keep teeth in place – silently.</strong></em>Dentures may slip when you eat, talk, smile, laugh, kiss, yawn or cough, so that you have to “reposition” them back into place in the mouth. Dental implants are fixed in place and fuse naturally with your jawbone, meaning your replacement teeth won’t move, click or shift.</li><li><em><strong>Protect your healthy teeth.</strong></em> Placing a tooth-supported bridge requires grinding away the teeth on one or both sides of the missing tooth or teeth – thereby damaging healthy teeth to restore those that are missing. The modified healthy teeth are attached to, and support, the bridge. Dental implants go in the jawbone, in the spot where your missing tooth root was, without impacting healthy teeth. They also help prevent healthy, adjacent teeth from shifting as they would if an empty space were left for an extended period of time.</li><li><em><strong>More predictable than other repair and restoration methods.</strong></em> Dental implant treatment has a track record of reliable, long-term successful outcomes and is often considered 'more predictable' than other treatments to repair or replace missing teeth, including bridgework, removable appliances and retreatment of failing root canal (endodontic) therapy.</li></ul>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"f2717993-6c7d-4b49-b512-95ac73b0e832":{"id":"f2717993-6c7d-4b49-b512-95ac73b0e832","index":5,"created_by":"48507cd8-1307-4505-8a34-1776f9a1ec1a","updated_by":"48507cd8-1307-4505-8a34-1776f9a1ec1a","created_at":"2016-08-06T21:59:03.128Z","updated_at":"2016-08-28T18:59:19.759Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-08-06-general-dentistry-in-bristol.md","_title":"General Dentistry in Bristol","metadata":{"@type":"MediaObject","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"At CK Dental we are proud of providing high quality general dentistry using the latest metal-free long-lasting filling materials (no mercury).
