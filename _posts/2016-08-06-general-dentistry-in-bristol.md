# General Dentistry in Bristol

At CK Dental we are proud of providing high quality general dentistry using the latest metal-free long-lasting filling materials (no mercury). These are naturally coloured and are almost undetectable. Research has really moved forward in this area and we are pleased to provide a real alternative to Amalgam fillings at an affordable rate.

All aspects of general dentistry are provided in a relaxed and friendly environment.

If you have any questions regarding our services, please send us an email to request an appointment. We would be more than happy to help you in all your dental needs.

Please note that every patient is different and in order to discuss your special requirements we will need to see you in person to allow us an opportunity to carry out an examination.

Our new patient examinations allow enough time to discuss your individual needs and there is no obligation to proceed with any of the treatment recommendations.
